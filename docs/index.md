## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JakobFinci/AMONgus-color-pooper/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### The BIG idea
We set out to create a highly relatable visually engaging artistic experience. We achieved this by incorporating visuals from both contemporary gaming culture and from relevant olin culture. 

### Progam Features
Unique features of our project involve the use of user input to create pieces of art as produced by the user. In the use of our program users can create unique pieces of art. We took inspiration from the etch-a-sketch toy to create this program's main functions.
