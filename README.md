# AMONgus Color Pooper
### A calming artistic experience 

## About the Project
This project was made as an homage to [Amon "Dr. Splat" Millner](amonmillner.com): the inventor of Scratch, polymath, legend among ~~us~~ men, sussy baka, and - most importantly - the **greatest** professor at Olin College of Engineering. Much like Dr. Millner, this game is a masterpiece and one of G-d's greatest creations. Listen to the soothing piano as Amon~~gus~~ [glides across the screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVWZy4QOy0) with the greatest of ease, like [butter](https://www.icantbelieveitsnotbutter.com/en), [pooping out rainbow ~~turds~~ pellets](https://www.michaels.com/assorted-funny-bunny-candy-pooper/10320564.html) as he goes!

## Controls
- Arrow Keys to Move Amon
- Space to Change Amon's Color
- ~~Whatever you do: don't enter the Konami Code!~~

## Songs Used:
- [~~Completely Normal~~ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys - Kevin MacLeod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMTEcjwKIQw)
- [Hollow Knight Piano Medley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjfJpUZy4Dk)

## Installation
This project was developed for conda-based python environments. As such, we do not guarantee that all dependencies are UNIX tested, nor that the core source code is compatible with the rendering interfacing on that OS.

## Setup
While this project is intended for use on a local setup, it may still be run on a smaller computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, with limited functionality.

For best results, we suggest having
- 2GB of RAM storage
- stable internet connection
- a means of displaying visuals

### Local Setup
1. First, clone the repository to your computer:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/olincollege/AMONgus-color-pooper.git
    ```

2. It's recommended that you run this project from a Python virtual environment with an anaconda interpreter, which can be set up like this:
    ```
    source /home/your-user/anaconda3/bin/activate
    conda activate base
    ```

3. If you don't already have pip installed, run this command from your new virtual environment:
    ```
    sudo apt install python-pip
    ```

4. Finally, use pip to install pygame
    ```
    pip install pygame
    ```
    
## Running the Code

### On your local machine
1. From a new terminal, navigate to the repository you just created
    ```
    cd [your-path-to-heaven-in-a-pygame]
    ```
    
2. Run the game, it's that simple!
    ```
    python3 game.py
    ```
